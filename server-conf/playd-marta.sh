# PLAY CONFIGURATION
#
# Point this script to your Play application directory and the name of the
# application to be executed, as well as on which port to accept connections
# on. Status method can be either PID or HTML, PID checks only for process
# with the id in the RUNNING_PID file in the application directory while
# HTML checks for a string within the HTML url document.
